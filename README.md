# Store-Sales-Calculator
Calculates Store Sales each day for a week.


Create a modular program using structured programming to store the amount of money a local
store made in sales for each day of the past week. The user will be given the option to enter an
amount for the next day, compute the average, find the highest amount, find the lowest amount,
or print all the information including the daily sales with the average, highest, and lowest
amount.
When the user chooses an option to enter an amount for the next day, the user will be prompted
to enter the amount. The amount must be greater than or equal to 0. If a negative amount is
entered the user will be given an error message and prompted to enter a value greater than or
equal to 0 for the same day. Once the user has entered a value greater than or equal to 0, that
amount will be saved. If the user attempts to enter more than seven days the program will give
the user an error message informing them the information for the entire week has already been
entered.
If the user chooses to compute the average, find the highest amount, or find the lowest amount
that amount will be printed to screen.
This program will only have one class which has static methods and uses a single array of size
seven to save the daily sales amounts. There should be a main method, a static method to get an
amount from the user, compute the average, find the lowest amount, find the highest amount, and
print out all the information.
